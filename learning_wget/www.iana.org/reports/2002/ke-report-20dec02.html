      <p>The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (the IANA), as part of the administrative 
        functions associated with management of the domain-name system root, is 
        responsible for receiving requests for delegation and redelegation of 
        top-level domains, investigating the circumstances pertinent to those 
        requests, and reporting on the requests. In June 2002, the IANA received 
        a request for the redelegation of the .ke (Kenya) country-code top-level 
        domain (ccTLD). This report gives the findings and conclusions of the 
        IANA on its investigation of that request.</p>
      <p><b><a name="FactualandProceduralBackground"></a>Factual and Procedural 
        Background</b></p>
      <p>The .ke ccTLD registry was first delegated by the IANA in April 1993 
        to Dr. Shem J. Ochuodho, Kenya, as administrative contact, and Mr. Randy 
        Bush, United States, as technical contact. At that time and today, that 
        two-letter code was and is <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/en/prods-services/iso3166ma/02iso-3166-code-lists/list-en1.html#gk">set 
        forth on the ISO 3166-1 list</a> maintained by the ISO 3166 Maintenance 
        Agency as the approved alpha-2 code for Kenya.</p>
      <p>Since the initial delegation, Dr. Ochuodho has served in a voluntary 
        capacity as the administrative contact for the .ke ccTLD. Likewise, from 
        1993 to the present, Mr. Bush has generously donated his time and energy 
        to serve as technical contact and provided a free domain-name-registration 
        mechanism and associated DNS services for the .ke registry.</p>
      <p>In May 2000, a group of Kenyan Internet stakeholders launched an initiative 
        to form a participatory, community-based non-profit organization located 
        in Kenya to manage both the administrative and technical aspects of the 
        .ke ccTLD registry. Since October 2001, there have been broad-based consultations 
        and research led by the Communications Commission of Kenya (CCK), with 
        the participation of stakeholders including the Telecommunications Service 
        Providers Association of Kenya (TESPOK), the East Africa Internet Association 
        (EAIA), Kenya Information Society (KIS), Kenya Education Network (KENET), 
        the Computer Society of Kenya, the Institute of Computer Science, the 
        Kenya Health Information Network, the Network Operators Association, Telkom 
        Kenya, the Kenyan government's Directorate of Information Technology Services, 
        and the National Task Force on Electronic Commerce (NTF-ecom). </p>
      <p>The result of these consultations was the Kenya Network Information Center, 
        Limited (KENIC), organized under Kenyan law as a company limited by guarantee 
        (a not-for-profit entity). In addition to performing the technical, administrative, 
        and policy-setting functions for the .ke registry, a <a href="http://www.kenic.or.ke/profile.htm">stated 
        objective of KENIC</a> is to &quot;promote, manage and operate the delegated 
        .ke ccTLD in the interest of the Kenyan Internet community and being mindful 
        of the global Internet community interest in consistent with ICANN policies.&quot;</p>
      <p>Through the KENIC website, open mailing lists, Steering Committee and 
        other organizational meetings, and public forums, the KENIC organizers 
        undertook to develop technical and administrative plans, and to take input 
        from and build support within the Kenyan Internet community. By mid-2002, 
        the KENIC organizers has completed KENIC's Memorandum &amp; Articles of 
        Association, and prepared and circulated for review and comment a draft 
        annual budget for registry operations and a draft set of registration 
        and administrative policies. Through the Computer Society of Kenya, an 
        open membership organization, the organizers undertook a public awareness 
        campaign aimed at increasing the involvement of individual and organizational 
        Internet users in KENIC.</p>
      <p>To get off the ground, KENIC has relied upon contributions from its various 
        members and supporters. For example, the member Internet service providers 
        of TESPOK pledged to contribute engineering talent to establish KENIC's 
        technical operations, and to provide a dedicated link between KENIC and 
        the Kenyan Internet Exchange Point (KIXP). The Computer Society of Kenya 
        pledged to pursue some donations of hardware from its members. Telkom 
        Kenya committed to supply two independent upstream links to the global 
        Internet. And the Communications Commission of Kenya pledged an initial 
        allocation of 10 million Kenyan shillings (approximately US $110,000) 
        to fund the start-up of KENIC.</p>
      <p>According to the organizers, one of the motivations for the KENIC process 
        was a growing dissatisfaction in the Kenyan Internet community with the 
        unresponsiveness of the current administrative contact, Dr. Ochuodho, 
        to the needs of the local Internet community. The KENIC organizers have 
        sought to involve Dr. Ochuodho in the community-based consultation process, 
        repeatedly stressing their belief that Dr. Ochuodho deserves much credit 
        for his dedicated and selfless labor to bring Internet connectivity and 
        services to Kenya, and to establish the .ke ccTLD registry. However, by 
        the late 1990s Dr. Ochuodho's commitments and demands on his time had 
        increased, seemingly limiting his ability to administer the .ke ccTLD 
        in a manner that fulfills the growing needs of the Kenyan Internet community. 
        Among his increase in responsibilities were heading up the African Regional 
        Centre for Computing (ARCC) and serving as a member of Kenya's national 
        parliament. For these understandable reasons, as he himself has noted 
        in conversation with IANA representatives, Dr. Ochuodho ceased to be as 
        active and accessible a participant in Kenya's rapidly expanding Internet 
        community as would be expected of a ccTLD delegee under these circumstances. 
      </p>
      <p>Above all, the organizers of KENIC expressed frustration that Dr. Ochuodho 
        had failed to engage in dialogue with the Kenyan Internet community about 
        any aspect of the .ke ccTLD. Through the KENIC process, the KENIC organizers 
        regularly and repeatedly invited Dr. Ochuodho to participate in their 
        initiative. He was invited to make a presentation or otherwise take part 
        in organizational meetings of the Steering Committee, to observe or speak 
        at KENIC's open community forums, to communicate his concerns or suggestions 
        via e-mail, and to join the board of directors of KENIC. Dr. Ochuodho 
        declined to respond to these invitations, and did not attend any of KENIC's 
        organizational meetings or open community forums. The KENIC organizers 
        regularly sent Dr. Ochuodho updates on their activities and minutes of 
        meetings and included him on their mailing lists, in the hope that he 
        might choose to participate or otherwise engage in dialogue toward the 
        creation of a stable institutional home in Kenya for the .ke registry.</p>
      <p>On 9 June 2002, KENIC representatives contacted the IANA to formally 
        request redelegation of the .ke ccTLD from the current administrative 
        contact to KENIC. That same day, the IANA forwarded the KENIC request 
        to Dr. Ochuodho, as the current administrative contact, for his review 
        and comment. On 10 July 2002, Dr. Ochuodho responded to the IANA that 
        his host ISP, ARCC, was hoping to upgrade its servers over the coming 
        several months, in order to assume responsibility for the .ke technical 
        functions. He further stated that &quot;[n]o ISP or KENIC has drawn our 
        attention to any substantial problems with current arrangement.&quot; 
      </p>
      <p>In view of Dr. Ochuodho's apparent failure to respond to or undertake 
        any discussions with the KENIC organizers on their dissatisfactions and 
        proposals, the IANA sought to promote dialog among the parties. After 
        several inquiries by the IANA, Dr. Ochuodho met with IANA representatives 
        (the President, Vice President, and Counsel for International Legal Affairs 
        of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)) at 
        the East Africa Internet Forum, held in Nairobi on 7 August 2002. </p>
      <p>At that meeting, Dr. Ochuodho acknowledged that he had been less than 
        responsive to the Kenyan Internet community over the previous several 
        years, but noted that he had been kept extremely busy by his other important 
        responsibilities, especially as a member of the Kenyan parliament. In 
        response to the KENIC redelegation request, Dr. Ochuodho expressed his 
        concerns with the KENIC process and organization, including his feeling 
        that the redelegation was politically motivated. </p>
      <p>In response, the IANA representatives pointed out that a ccTLD administrative 
        contact serves as a trustee on behalf of, and in service to, the local 
        Internet community. As trustee, the administrative contact must act fairly 
        and in the best interests of the entire local Internet community, be responsive 
        to the members of that community, and engage in dialogue about issues 
        relating to the ccTLD. </p>
      <p>Dr. Ochuodho stated that he accepted these responsibilities, and agreed 
        to undertake direct dialogue with the KENIC organizers in an effort to 
        resolve his concerns and to attempt to reach a mutually acceptable set 
        of management arrangements for the .ke ccTLD. In any event, Dr. Ochuodho 
        agreed to report to the IANA on the results of those discussions within 
        30 days. At the face-to-face meeting, Dr. Ochuodho agreed that within 
        30 days, he would either: (a) work out a solution with KENIC on the management 
        of the .ke ccTLD; (b) demonstrate significant support within the Kenyan 
        Internet community for administration of the .ke ccTLD by him rather than 
        KENIC; or (c) agree to the redelegation of the .ke ccTLD. </p>
      <p>The IANA sent a follow-up e-mail to Dr. Ochuodho reiterating these commitments 
        and noting that in the event that neither (a) or (b) occurred within the 
        set 30 days, the IANA intended to proceed with the redelegation according 
        to its procedures. Dr. Ochuodho did not respond to that e-mail. Indeed, 
        the IANA has not received any direct communications from Dr. Ochuodho 
        since that meeting.</p>
      <p>On 18 October 2002, <a href="/cctld/ke/kyungu-to-lynn-18oct02.htm">Permanent 
        Secretary Sammy Kyungu of the Kenyan government’s Ministry of Transport 
        and Communications wrote to ICANN's President to reiterate the Kenyan 
        government's recognition of KENIC</a> &quot;as the appropriate entity 
        to hold the delegation of authority by the ICANN for administrative authority 
        of the .ke country code top level domain (ccTLD).&quot; Permanent Secretary 
        Kyungu specified that the Kenyan government's recognition was conditional 
        on KENIC operating within the provisions of its Memorandum &amp; Articles 
        of Association, and stated the commitment of the Kenyan government to 
        fulfill its responsibilities as envisioned in the &quot;<a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm">Principles 
        for the Delegation and Administration of Country Code Top Level Domains</a>&quot; 
        adopted by ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC) on 23 February 
        2000. Permanent Secretary Kyungu also noted that Kenya's government was 
        a regular and active participant in the GAC.</p>
      <p>Indicating that the respective roles and responsibilities of the Kenyan 
        government and KENIC had been detailed in a <a href="/cctld/ke/chepkonga-to-kyungu-21jun02.htm">communication 
        dated 21 June 2002</a>, Permanent Secretary Kyungu stated that the Kenyan 
        government would &quot;require that KENIC Limited manage the .ke top-level 
        domain according to the interest of the Kenyan public and particularly 
        its Internet community.&quot; The letter further detailed a set of anticipated 
        policy coordination practices designed to minimize the likelihood of conflict 
        between governmental and global policy requirements, and endorsed the 
        standard ICANN-ccTLD contractual mechanisms for redelegation and the designation 
        of a successor registry operator.</p>
      <p>Over the past several months, KENIC has named an interim CEO and recruited 
        a pair of engineers with strong software and networking skills. The engineers 
        have been pursuing relevant training in registry software tools and operations, 
        including a period in residence at the .ug registry in Kampala. KENIC's 
        technical committee has been proceeding with the design of technical infrastructure, 
        the acquisition of hardware and software, and the preparation of transition 
        plans. In addition, KENIC has established various working groups to address 
        policy issues such as registration pricing, consideration of a registry/registrar 
        model, and dispute resolution. An open public forum was held in Nairobi 
        on 8 August 2002, at which speakers presented elements of KENIC's proposed 
        organizational, technical, and policy arrangements, and took comments 
        and suggestions from the audience. KENIC has established an open e-mail 
        list for the discussion of policy matters. </p>
      <p>KENIC and ICANN have agreed on language for a Sponsorship Agreement under 
        which KENIC would assume the responsibility as sponsoring organization/delegee 
        of the .ke ccTLD. On 18 November 2002, the ICANN Board of Directors <a href="http://www.icann.org/minutes/prelim-report-18nov02.htm#ccTLDAgreementforke">authorized 
        ICANN</a> to enter this Sponsorship Agreement, which closely parallels 
        the <a href="http://www.icann.org/cctlds/model-tscsa-31jan02.htm">model 
        Sponsorship Agreement</a> ICANN has developed for triangular relationships 
        among ICANN, private-sector sponsoring organizations, and the relevant 
        national governments. </p>
      <p><b><a name="Evaluation"></a>Evaluation</b></p>
      <p>This report is being provided under the <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/iana-contract-21mar01.htm">contract 
        for performance of the IANA function</a> between the United States Government 
        and ICANN. Under that contract, ICANN performs the IANA function, which 
        <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/iana-contract-21mar01.htm#sow2.1.1.2">includes</a> 
        receiving delegation and redelegation requests concerning ccTLDs, investigating 
        the circumstances pertinent to those requests, and reporting on the requests.</p>
      <p>In acting on redelegation requests, the IANA currently follows the practices 
        summarized in &quot;<a href="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm">Internet 
        Domain Name System Structure and Delegation</a>&quot; (ICP-1). ICP-1 represents 
        an update of the portions of <a href="http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1591.txt">RFC&nbsp;1591</a> 
        (which was issued in March 1994) dealing with ccTLDs, and reflects subsequent 
        documents and evolution of the policies followed by the IANA through May 
        1999.</p>
      <p>In considering delegation or redelegation of a ccTLD, the IANA seeks 
        input from persons significantly affected by the transfer, particularly 
        those within the nation or territory which the ccTLD has been established 
        to benefit. As <a href="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm#a">noted in 
        ICP-1</a>, the parties affected include especially the relevant government 
        or public authority: &quot;The desires of the government of a country 
        with regard to delegation of a ccTLD are taken very seriously. The IANA 
        will make them a major consideration in any TLD delegation/transfer discussions.&quot;</p>
      <p>The presence or absence of mutual agreement of the old and new delegees 
        is a significant factor in determining whether redelegation is appropriate. 
        As stated in ICP-1 (echoing RFC 1591): &quot;In the event of a conflict 
        over designation of a TLD manager, the IANA tries to have conflicting 
        parties reach agreement among themselves and generally takes no action 
        unless all contending parties agree.&quot; Nonetheless, in past circumstances 
        where &quot;the parties involved in proposed delegations or transfers 
        have not been able to reach an agreement[,] the IANA has been required 
        to resolve the matter.&quot;<a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> Characteristically, 
        these circumstances have involved an overwhelming demonstration, without 
        adequate rebuttal, of relevant support for redelegation. See <a href="/reports/pn-report-11feb00.htm">IANA 
        Report on Request for Redelegation of the .pn Top-Level Domain</a> (11 
        February 2000).</p>
      <p>In the case of .ke, the current administrative contact has not agreed 
        to the proposed redelegation to KENIC. However, he has also not responded 
        to the many efforts of participants in the Kenyan Internet community to 
        discuss with him their concerns regarding the .ke ccTLD. The KENIC organizers 
        have made every reasonable attempt to include Dr. Ochuodho into their 
        process, to engage him in dialogue, and to develop a commonly acceptable 
        plan to which he would consent, but Dr. Ochuodho has not responded to 
        these attempts. Where serious concerns are raised within the local Internet 
        community, the administrative contact should seek to discuss, and as appropriate 
        address, those concerns.</p>
      <p>Dr. Ochuodho has similarly failed to respond to the IANA's inquiries. 
        The IANA has repeatedly asked him to provide some response to the considerable 
        documentation of Kenyan Internet community support that has been provided 
        by KENIC. However, he has sent no acknowledgement, response, or rebuttal 
        to this documentation, other than his allegations of political motivation 
        at his meeting with IANA representatives on 7 August 2002. He has not 
        responded to the IANA's requests that he come forth, in response to the 
        widely expressed community concerns, with evidence of community support 
        for his continued role as administrative contact, or evidence of dissatisfaction 
        with KENIC. He has not fulfilled his commitment, agreed at the 7 August 
        2002 meeting, that within thirty days he would either (a) work out a solution 
        with KENIC on the management of the .ke ccTLD; (b) demonstrate significant 
        support within the Kenyan Internet community for administration of the 
        .ke ccTLD by him rather than KENIC; or (c) agree to the redelegation of 
        the .ke ccTLD.</p>
      <p>Based on the circumstances described above, the IANA concludes that redelegation 
        is warranted in this case despite the objections of the current administrative 
        contact. Under IANA policy, ccTLD redelegation requests are measured primarily 
        by two yardsticks: technical competence and the views of the local Internet 
        community. In the case of .ke, the overwhelming consensus of the views 
        that have been expressed to the IANA is that KENIC has won the support 
        of a wide range of Kenyan Internet stakeholders, including Internet service 
        providers, users (academic, non-commercial, and business), and the government. 
        Documentary evidence of support was reinforced at the meeting of IANA 
        representatives with leaders of these communities in Nairobi in August 
        2002, in which the common message to the IANA was one of support for KENIC 
        and a desire to see a change of delegation. The desire of the Kenyan Internet 
        stakeholders that comprise KENIC to see the .ke registry operated on a 
        professional basis within Kenya is reasonable, and is consistent with 
        the principle that ccTLDs should serve and be responsive to the Internet 
        communities in the countries or territories with which they are associated. 
        Consistent with longstanding IANA policy, the IANA also gives significant 
        weight to the views of the Kenyan government, which has expressed its 
        confidence in KENIC as a community-based, open, participatory, non-governmental 
        administrator for the .ke registry.</p>
      <p>The current technical contact, Randy Bush, is, as noted above, providing 
        registry services for the .ke domain on a volunteer basis. (Mr. Bush generously 
        provides this free service for many ccTLDs in Africa and elsewhere.) KENIC 
        has recruited talented and experienced engineering staff and has developed 
        and begun to implement a realistic plan to achieve stable and competent 
        technical registry operations within the next several months. This is 
        in preparation for a change of technical contact from Mr. Bush to KENIC 
        at such time as KENIC is in a position to take on these responsibilities. 
        Mr. Bush does not object to someone with demonstrated technical competence 
        taking over the technical responsibility.</p>
      <p>In concluding that redelegation is appropriate, the IANA does not question 
        the substantial contributions of good faith of Dr. Ochuodho. Since 1993, 
        he has provided, without compensation, a valuable service to Kenya, in 
        the best traditions of the Internet. During his service, the Internet 
        has arrived and grown enormously in Kenya. With hundreds of thousands 
        of users now going online every day, it is not surprising that the Kenyan 
        Internet community would seek to have the administration of the .ke registry 
        shifted from a single individual to a stable and reliable institutional 
        setting, with open and participatory policymaking procedures, professional 
        staffing, and competent technical operations located within Kenya. Dr. 
        Ochuodho deserves credit for establishing the .ke registry and shepherding 
        its development to this point. In that sense, the IANA's redelegation 
        determination is a consequence of the growth and maturation of the Kenyan 
        Internet community, and should not be taken as a criticism of Dr. Ochuodho's 
        voluntary stewardship.</p>
      <p>Although the IANA is grateful for Dr. Ochuodho's years of volunteer service 
        to the Kenyan and global Internet communities, administrative contacts 
        are obligated to communicate with the IANA and be responsive to important 
        issues such as serious redelegation requests. An administrative contact 
        is by no means expected to agree with the IANA in all matters, but, as 
        the trustee to which the IANA has delegated the duty to serve the local 
        and global Internet communities, an administrative contact is certainly 
        required to communicate with the IANA, particularly on matters of evidently 
        strong concern to significant Internet stakeholders in the country or 
        territory. When specifically documented concerns about a ccTLD's operation 
        are presented to the IANA, it is incumbent on the administrative contact 
        to present the IANA with an adequate rebuttal.</p>
      <p>In February 2000, the <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/">ICANN 
        Governmental Advisory Committee</a> (GAC) issued a document entitled &quot;<a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm">Principles 
        for the Delegation and Administration of Country Code Top Level Domains</a>,&quot; 
        commonly known as the &quot;GAC Principles.&quot; These principles serve 
        as &quot;best practices&quot; to guide governments in assuming proper 
        roles with respect to the Internet's naming system, which the GAC has 
        observed is a public resource to be administered in the public interest. 
        In general, they recognize that each government has the ultimate responsibility 
        within its territory for its national public-policy objectives, but also 
        that ICANN has the responsibility for ensuring that the Internet domain-name 
        system continues to provide an effective and interoperable global naming 
        system. The GAC Principles recommend that governments and ICANN pursue 
        their respective roles by creating a framework for accountability memorialized 
        in communications with each other and with the ccTLD manager (see <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#2">clause 
        2</a>). The GAC Principles guide governments on how to responsibly structure 
        their relations with ccTLD managers (see clauses <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#5.5">5.5</a> 
        and <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#9">9</a>). 
        Among these specific principles, the best practices contemplate that governments 
        will ensure that the ccTLD manager complies with ICANN policies related 
        to global coordination of the Internet DNS (clauses <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#9.1.7">9.1.7</a> 
        and <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#9.1.8">9.1.8</a>).</p>
      <p>KENIC has committed itself to the GAC principles, and its responsibilities 
        under clause 9, as confirmed in a 25 October 2002 communication from the 
        KENIC as provided for by the Ministry of Transport and Communications. 
        Similarly, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and the Communications 
        Commission of Kenya (CCK) have committed, on behalf of the Kenyan government, 
        to fulfill its public-interest responsibilities, to support the successful 
        non-governmental operation of the .ke registry, and to respect the particular 
        roles and responsibilities of KENIC and ICANN.</p>
      <p><b><a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</b></p>
      <p>The structure proposed by KENIC and endorsed by the Kenyan government 
        is to have KENIC undertake management of the .ke ccTLD under appropriate 
        oversight of the Kenyan government (concerning national public-policy 
        interests) and ICANN (concerning global technical-coordination interests). 
        This structure is consonant with the principle of private-sector responsibility 
        for technical coordination under which the Internet has flourished. In 
        reviewing the request and in light of (a)&nbsp;the Kenyan government's 
        endorsement of KENIC as the appropriate private-sector manager and (b)&nbsp;KENIC's 
        willingness to enter a Sponsorship Agreement embodying an appropriate 
        framework of accountability, the IANA concludes that KENIC is the appropriate 
        delegee of the .ke ccTLD.</p>
      <p>One mechanism to reflect an appropriate framework of accountability is 
        the arrangement embodied in the GAC Principles. Where, as here, the relevant 
        government is prepared to carry out the ultimate responsibility for overseeing 
        the ccTLD manager's service to the local Internet community and the manager 
        is prepared to conduct itself within that framework, the interests of 
        the local and global Internet communities are served by ICANN joining 
        into that cooperative arrangement.</p>
      <p>Two of the three parts of that arrangement&nbsp;&#150; the KENIC/Government 
        and Government/ICANN communications&nbsp;&#150; have already been implemented. 
        Upon signing of the ICANN/KENIC sponsorship agreement, which reflects 
        the principles set forth in <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#10">clause 
        10 of the GAC Principles</a>, adjusted as necessary to suit local circumstances, 
        the .ke ccTLD administrative role should be redelgated to KENIC.</p>
      <p>Until such time as KENIC has completed the establishment of a competent 
        technical capability and is ready to take on the responsibility so that 
        a smooth transfer of technical functions to KENIC can responsibly be accomplished, 
        Randy Bush will remain the technical contact as designated by KENIC under 
        its Sponsorship Agreement with ICANN.</p>

                                    signs, thinking they would be some interest to posterity in a Museum of Horrors. --Stetson
                                    Kennedy</em><sup><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span>1</span></span></sup><br /><br /> I am a garbage collector, racist garbage. For three decades I have collected items
                                 that defame and belittle Africans and their American descendants. I have a parlor
                                 game, "72 Pictured Party Stunts," from the 1930s. One of the game's cards instructs
                                 players to, "Go through the motions of a colored boy eating watermelon." The card
                                 shows a dark black boy, with bulging eyes and blood red lips, eating a watermelon
                                 as large as he is. The card offends me, but I collected it and 4,000 similar items
                                 that portray blacks as Coons, Toms, Sambos, Mammies, Picaninnies, and other dehumanizing
                                 racial caricatures. I collect this garbage because I believe, and know to be true,
                                 that items of intolerance can be used to teach tolerance.<br /><br /> <img class="imgl" style="margin: 5px 10px; border: 1px solid black; float: left;"
                                      src="http://www.ferris.edu/HTMLS/news/jimcrow/collect/shaker.jpg"
                                      alt="Mammy"

                                      height="200" /> I bought my first racist object when I was 12 or 13. My memory of that event is not
                                 perfect. It was the early 1970s in Mobile, Alabama, the home of my youth. The item
                                 was small, probably a Mammy saltshaker. It must have been cheap because I never had
                                 much money. And, it must have been ugly because after I paid the dealer I threw the
                                 item to the ground, shattering it. It was not a political act; I, simply, hated it,
                                 if you can hate an object. I do not know if he scolded me, he almost certainly did.
                                 I was what folks in Mobile, blacks and whites, indelicately referred to as a "Red
                                 Nigger." In those days, in that place, he could have thrown that name at me, without
                                 incident. I do not remember what he called me, but I am certain he called me something
                                 other than David Pilgrim.<br /><br /> I have a 1916 magazine advertisement that shows a little black boy, softly caricatured,
                                 drinking from an ink bottle. The bottom caption reads, "Nigger Milk." I bought the
                                 print in 1988 from an antique store in LaPorte, Indiana. It was framed and offered
                                 for sale at $20. The salesclerk wrote, "Black Print," on the receipt. I told her to
                                 write, "Nigger Milk Print."<br /><br /> <img class="imgl" style="margin: 5px 10px; border: 1px solid black; float: right;"
                                      src="http://www.ferris.edu/HTMLS/news/jimcrow/collect/milk.jpg"
                                      alt="Nigger Milk"
                                      width="115"
                                      height="155" /> "If you are going to sell it, call it by its name," I told her. She refused. We argued.
                                 I bought the print and left. That was my last argument with a dealer or sales clerk;
                                 today, I purchase the items and leave with little conversation. <br /><br /> The Mammy saltshaker and the "Nigger Milk" print are not the most offensive items
                                 that I have seen. In 1874, McLoughlin Brothers of New York manufactured a puzzle game
                                 called "Chopped Up Niggers." Today, the game is a prized collectible. I have twice
                                 seen the game for sale; neither time did I have the $3,000 necessary to purchase it.
                                 There are postcards from the first half of the 20th century that show blacks being
                                 whipped, or worse, hanging dead from trees, or lying on the ground burned beyond recognition.
                                 Postcards and photographs of lynched blacks sell for around $400 each on eBay and
                                 other Internet auction houses. I can afford to buy one, but I am not ready, not yet.<br /><br /> My friends claim that I am obsessed with racist objects. If they are right, the obsession
                                 began while I was an undergraduate student at Jarvis Christian College, a small historically
                                 black institution in Hawkins, Texas. The teachers taught more than scientific principles
                                 and mathematical equations. I learned from them what it was like to live as a black
                                 man under Jim Crow segregation. Imagine being a college professor but having to wear
                                 a chauffeur's hat while driving <em>your</em> new car through small towns, lest some disgruntled white man beat you for being "uppity."
                                 The stories I heard were not angry ones; no, worse, they were matter-of-fact accounts
                                 of everyday life in a land where every black person was considered inferior to every
                                 white one, a time when "social equality" was a profane expression, fighting words.
                                 Blacks knew their clothing sizes. Why? They were not allowed to try on clothes in
                                 department stores. If blacks and whites wore the same clothes, even for a short while,
                                 it implied social equality, and, perhaps, intimacy.<br /><br /> I was 10 years old when Martin Luther King, Jr. was killed; we watched the funeral
                                 on a small black and white television in my fifth grade class at Bessie C. Fonville
                                 Elementary. All my classmates were black; Mobile was proudly, defiantly segregated.
                                 Two years later, in search for a cheaper house, my family moved to Prichard, Alabama,
                                 a small adjoining city that was even more segregated. Less than a decade earlier,
                                 blacks had not been allowed to use the Prichard City Library -- unless they had a
                                 note from a white person. Whites owned most of the stores. Whites held all the elected
                                 offices. I was part of the class that integrated Prichard Middle School. A local television
                                 commentator called it an "invasion." Invaders? We were children. We fought adult whites
                                 on the way to school and white children at school. By the time I graduated from Mattie
                                 T. Blount High School most of the whites had left the city. When I arrived at Jarvis
                                 Christian College I was not naive about southern race relations.<br /><br /> My college teachers taught the usual lessons about Frederick Douglass, Sojourner
                                 Truth, Booker T. Washington, and W.E.B. Dubois. More importantly, they taught about
                                 the daily heroism of the maids, butlers, and sharecroppers who risked their jobs,
                                 and sometimes their lives, to protest Jim Crow segregation. I learned to read history
                                 critically, from the "bottom-up," not as a linear critique of so-called great men,
                                 but from the viewpoint of oppressed people. I realized the great debt that I owed
                                 to the blacks -- all but a few forgotten by history -- who suffered so that I could
                                 be educated. It was at Jarvis Christian College that I learned that a scholar could
                                 be an activist, indeed, must be. Here, I first had the idea of building a collection
                                 of racist objects. I was not sure what I would do with it.<br /><br /> <img class="imgl" style="margin: 1px 5px; border: 1px solid black; float: left;"

                                 as often or in as many ways as have black Americans. Blacks have been portrayed in
                                 popular culture as pitiable exotics, cannibalistic savages, hypersexual deviants,
                                 childlike buffoons, obedient servants, self-loathing victims, and menaces to society.
                                 These anti-black depictions were routinely manifested in or on material objects: ashtrays,
                                 drinking glasses, banks, games, fishing lures, detergent boxes, and other everyday
                                 items. These objects, with racist representations, both reflected and shaped attitudes
                                 towards African Americans. Robbin Henderson (Faulkner, Henderson, Fabry, &amp; Miller,
                                 1982), director of the Berkeley Art Center, said, "derogatory imagery enables people
                                 to absorb stereotypes; which in turn allows them to ignore and condone injustice,
                                 discrimination, segregation, and racism" (p. 11). She was right. Racist imagery is
                                 propaganda and that propaganda was used to support Jim Crow laws and customs.<br /><br /> <img class="imgl" style="float: right; margin: 5px 10px; border: 1px solid black;"

                                      height="200" /> Jim Crow was more than a series of "Whites Only" signs. It was a way of life that
                                 approximated a racial caste system (Woodward, 1974). Jim Crow laws and etiquette were
                                 aided by millions of material objects that portrayed blacks as laughable, detestable
                                 inferiors. The Coon caricature, for example, depicted black men as lazy, easily frightened,
                                 chronically idle, inarticulate, physically ugly idiots. This distorted representation
                                 of black men found its way onto postcards, sheet music, children's games, and many
                                 other material objects. The Coon and other stereotypical images of blacks buttressed
                                 the view that blacks were unfit to attend racially integrated schools, live in safe
                                 neighborhoods, work in responsible jobs, vote, and hold public office. With little
                                 effort I can hear the voices of my black elders -- parents, neighbors, teachers --
                                 demanding, almost pleading, "Don't be Coon, be a man." Living under Jim Crow meant
                                 battling shame.<br /><br /> <img class="imgl" style="margin: 1px 5px; border: 1px solid black; float: left;"

                                      height="200" /> I collected many racist objects during my four years as a graduate student at The
                                 Ohio State University. Most of the items were small and inexpensive. I paid $2 for
                                 a postcard that showed a terrified black man being eaten by an alligator. I paid $5
                                 for a matchbox that showed a Sambo-like character with oversized genitalia. The collection
                                 that I amassed was not a sample of what existed in Ohio -- or anywhere; it was, instead,
                                 a sample of what I could afford. Brutally racist items were, and remain, the most
                                 expensive "black collectibles." In Orrville, Ohio, I saw a framed print showing naked
                                 black children climbing a fence to enter a swimming hole. The caption read, "Last
                                 One In's A Nigger." I did not have the $125 to purchase it. That was the early 1980s,
                                 a few years before the prices for racist collectibles escalated. Today, that print,
                                 if authentic, sells for several thousand dollars. On vacation, I scoured flea markets
                                 and antique stores from Ohio to Alabama, looking for items that denigrated black people.<br /><br /> My years at The Ohio State University were, I realize now, filled with much anger.
                                 I suppose every sane black person must be angry, at least for a while. I was in the
                                 Sociology Department, a politically liberal department, and talk about improving race
                                 relations was common. There were five or six black students, and we clung together
                                 like frightened outsiders. I will not speak for my black colleagues, but I was sincerely
                                 doubtful of my white professors' understanding of everyday racism. Their lectures
                                 were often brilliant, but never complete. Race relations were fodder for theoretical
                                 debate; blacks were a "research category." Real blacks, with real ambitions and problems,
                                 were problematic. I was suspicious of my white teachers and they reciprocated. <br /><br /> <img class="imgl" style="margin: 1px 5px; float: right; border: 1px solid black;"
                                      src="http://www.ferris.edu/HTMLS/news/jimcrow/collect/robeson.jpg"

                                      height="200" /> A friend suggested that I take some of my "elective courses" in the Black Studies
                                 Program. I did. James Upton, a Political Scientist, introduced me to Paul Robeson's
                                 book <em>Here I Stand</em> (1958). Robeson, an accomplished athlete and entertainer, was also an activist who
                                 believed that American capitalism was pernicious and detrimental to poor people, especially
                                 black Americans. Robeson maintained his political convictions despite ostracism and
                                 outright persecution. I was not anti-capitalism, but I admired his willingness to
                                 follow his political convictions -- and his unwavering fight for the rights of oppressed
                                 people. I read many books about race and race relations but few had as much impact
                                 on me as <em>Here I Stand</em>. I read James Baldwin's novels and essays. His anger found a willing ear, but I was
                                 troubled by his homosexuality. That is hardly surprising. I was reared in a community
                                 that was demonstratively homophobic. Homosexuality was seen as weakness, and "sissies"
                                 were "bad luck." White bigots do not have a monopoly on ignorance. Progressiveness
                                 is a journey. I had a long way to go.<br /><br /> I have long felt that Americans, especially whites, would rather talk about slavery
                                 than Jim Crow. All ex-slaves are dead. They do not walk among us, their presence a
                                 reminder of that unspeakably cruel system. Their children are dead. Distanced by a
                                 century and a half, the modern American sees slavery as a regrettable period when
                                 blacks worked without wages. Slavery was, of course, much worse. It was the complete
                                 domination of one people by another people -- with the expected abuses that accompany
                                 unchecked power. Slavers whipped slaves who displeased them. Clergy preached that
                                 slavery was the will of God. Scientists "proved" that blacks were less evolved, a
                                 subspecies of the human race and politicians agreed. Teachers taught young children
                                 that blacks were inherently less intelligent. Laws forbade slaves, and sometimes free
                                 blacks, from learning to read and write, possessing money, and arguing with whites.
                                 Slaves were property -- thinking, suffering property. The passing of a century and
                                 a half affords the typical American enough "psychological space" to deal with slavery;
                                 when that is not sufficient, a sanitized version of slavery is embraced.<br /><br /> The horrors of Jim Crow are not so easily ignored. The children of Jim Crow walk
                                 among us, and they have stories to tell. They remember Emmett Till, murdered in 1955,
                                 for an interchange with a white woman. Long before the tragic bombings of September
                                 11, 2001, blacks who lived under Jim Crow were acquainted with terrorism. On Sunday,
                                 September 15, 1963, the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, a black church in Birmingham,
                                 Alabama was bombed. Twenty-three people were hurt, and four girls were killed. The
                                 blacks who grew up during the Jim Crow period can tell you about this bombing -- and
                                 many others. Blacks who dared protest the indignities of Jim Crow were threatened,
                                 and when the threats did not work, subjected to violence, including bombings. The
                                 children of Jim Crow can talk about the Scottsboro boys, the Tuskegee Experiment,
                                 lynchings, and the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. and they have stories
                                 about the daily indignities that befell blacks who lived in towns where they were
                                 not respected or wanted.<br /><br /> Yes, many of us would rather talk about slavery than Jim Crow because a discussion
                                 of Jim Crow begs the question: "What about today?"<br /><br /> <img class="imgl" style="margin: 1px 5px; float: right; border: 1px solid black;"

                                 Michigan. It was my second teaching position and my third "real" job. At that time,
                                 my collection of racist artifacts numbered more than 1,000. I kept the collection
                                 in my home, bringing out pieces when I gave public addresses, mainly to high school
                                 students. I discovered that many young people, blacks and whites, were not only ignorant
                                 about historical expressions of racism, but they believed that I was exaggerating
                                 when I described the awfulness of Jim Crow. Their ignorance disappointed me. I showed
                                 them segregation signs, Ku Klux Klan robes, and everyday objects that portrayed blacks
                                 with ragged clothes, unkempt hair, bulging eyes, and clown-like lips -- running toward
                                 fried chicken and watermelons and running away from alligators. I talked to the students
                                 about the connection between Jim Crow laws and racist material objects. I was too
                                 heavy-handed, too driven to make them understand; I was, that is, learning to use
                                 the objects as teaching tools -- while, simultaneously, dealing with my anger.<br /><br /> A seminal event occurred in 1991. A colleague told me about an elderly black woman
                                 who had a large collection of black-related objects. I will call her Mrs. Haley. She
                                 was an antique dealer in a small Indiana town. I visited her and told her about my
                                 collection. She seemed unimpressed. I described how I used the racist objects to teach
                                 students about racism. Again, she was not impressed. Her store displayed a few pieces
                                 of racist memorabilia. I asked if she kept most of the "black material" at her home.
                                 She said that she kept those pieces in the back, but I could only see them if I agreed
                                 to a condition, namely, I could never "pester" her to sell me any of the objects.
                                 I agreed. She locked the front door, put the "closed" sign in the window, and motioned
                                 for me to follow her.<br /><br /> If I live to be 100 I will never forget the feeling that I had when I saw her collection;
                                 it was sadness, a thick, cold sadness. There were hundreds, maybe thousands, of objects,
                                 side-by-side, on shelves that reached to the ceiling. All four walls were covered
                                 with some of the most racist objects imaginable. I owned some of the objects, others
                                 I had seen in Black Memorabilia price guides, and others were so rare I have not seen
                                 them since. I was stunned. Sadness. It was as if I could hear the pieces talking,
                                 yowling. Every conceivable distortion of black people, our people, was on display.
                                 It was a chamber of horrors. She did not talk. She stared at me; I stared at the objects.
                                 One was a life-sized wooden figure of a black man, grotesquely caricatured. It was
                                 a testament to the creative energy that often lurks behind racism. On her walls was
                                 a material record of all the hurt and harm done to Africans and their American descendants.
                                 I wanted to cry. It was at that moment that I decided to create a museum.<br /><br /> <img class="imgl" style="margin: 1px 5px; float: left; border: 1px solid black;"

                                      height="200" /> I visited her often. She liked me because I was "from down home." She told me that
                                 in the 1960s and 1970s many whites gave her racist objects. They did not want to be
                                 identified with racism. They were embarrassed. That sentiment changed in the mid-1980s.
                                 Several price guides devoted solely to racist collectibles were published. The price
                                 guides helped create the contemporary market for racist collectibles. Each new price
                                 guide showed prices escalating, and a national pursuit of racist items ensued. Mrs.
                                 Haley's collection was worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, but she had no desire
                                 to sell the pieces. They were our past, America's past. "We mustn't forget, baby,"
                                 she said, without even a hint of anger. I stopped visiting after a year or so, she
                                 died, and I heard that her collection was sold to private dealers. That broke my heart
                                 on several levels. It bothers me that she did not live to see the museum she helped
                                 inspire.<br /><br /> I continued to collect racist objects: musical records with racist themes, fishing
                                 lures with Sambo imagery, children's games that showed naked, dirty black children
                                 -- any and every racist item that I could afford. In the cold months I bought from
                                 antique stores; in the warmer months, I traveled to flea markets. I was impatient.
                                 I sought to purchase entire collections from dealers and collectors. Again, limited
                                 finances restricted me to purchasing only small collections.<br /><br /> <img class="imgl" style="margin: 1px 5px; float: right; border: 1px solid black;"

                                      height="200" /> In 1994 I was part of a three-person team from Ferris State University that attended
                                 a two-week workshop at Colorado College, in Colorado Springs. The conference, sponsored
                                 by the Lilly Foundation, was devoted to the liberal arts. The charge to our team was
                                 to introduce "diversity" into the general education curriculum at Ferris State University.
                                 I traveled with Mary Murnik, a colleague, to all the local antique stores. Colorado
                                 Springs is a politically conservative city, not surprisingly, there were many racist
                                 items for sale -- some vintage, many reproductions. I bought several segregation signs,
                                 a Coon Chicken Inn glass, three racist ashtrays, and many other items. I also bought
                                 several 1920s records, all with racist themes, from a dealer who tried to talk about
                                 "the problem with colored people." I wanted the records; I did not want the conversation.
                                 John Thorp, the other member of the team, and I spent hours planning a strategy to
                                 convince the Ferris State University administration to give physical space and money
                                 to a room that would house my racist collectibles. It took several years but he and
                                 I were successful.<br /><br /> <img class="imgl" style="margin: 1px 5px; float: left; border: 1px solid black;"

                                 get it out of my home. I donated my entire collection to the university, with the
                                 condition that the objects would be displayed and preserved. I never liked having
                                 the objects in my home. I had small children. They would wander to the basement and
                                 look at "daddy's dolls" -- two mannequins dressed in full Ku Klux Klan regalia. They
                                 played with the racist target games. One of them, I do not know which, broke a "Tom"
                                 cookie jar. I was angry for two days. The irony is not lost to me.<br /><br /> The museum will function as a teaching laboratory. Ferris State University faculty
                                 and students use the museum to understand historical expressions of racism. The museum
                                 also includes items created after the Jim Crow period ended; this is a valuable addition
                                 because too many students were dismissing racism as a "thing of the past." Scholars
                                 conducting research, mainly social scientists, also visit the museum. Only rarely
                                 are children allowed in the room, and adults -- preferably their parents -- are encouraged
                                 to accompany them. We encourage all visitors to watch Marlon Rigg's documentary, <em>Ethnic Notions</em> (Riggs, 1987) or <em>Jim Crow's Museum</em> (Pilgrim &amp; Rye, 2004), a documentary I produced and Clayton Rye directed before entering
                                 the room. A trained museum facilitator is there for all tours. Clergy, civil rights
                                 groups and human rights organizations also visit the museum.<br /><br /> The mission of the Jim Crow Museum is straightforward: use items of intolerance to
                                 teach tolerance. We examine the historical patterns of race relations and the origins
                                 and consequences of racist depictions. The aim is to engage visitors in open and honest
                                 dialogues about this country's racial history. We are not afraid to talk about race
                                 and racism; we are afraid not to. I continue to deliver public presentations at high
                                 schools and colleges. Race relations suffer when discussions of race and racism are
                                 verboten. High schools that "sincerely" include race, racism, and diversity in their
                                 curriculums increase tolerance for others. It is relatively easy to identify those
                                 high schools that are afraid or unwilling to honestly examine race and racism. There
                                 you will find a 1950s-like pattern of everyday race relations. Racial stereotypes
                                 will dominate, though they may go unspoken. Inevitably, there will be a "racial incident,"
                                 -- a racial slur hurled, a fight blamed on "the other," -- and there will be no relevant
                                 foundation laid for dealing with the problem, other than hiring me or a similar "diversity
                                 consultant" to restore order. The Jim Crow Museum is founded on the belief that open,
                                 honest, even painful discussions about race are necessary to avoid yesterday's mistakes.<br /><br /> Our goal is not to shock visitors. A thick naivet'e about America's past permeates
                                 this country. Many Americans understand historical racism mainly as a general abstraction:
                                 Racism existed; it was bad, though probably not as bad as blacks and other minorities
                                 claim. A confrontation with the visual evidence of racism -- especially thousands
                                 of items in a small room -- is frequently shocking, even painful. In the late 1800s
                                 traveling carnivals and amusement parks sometimes included a game called "Hit the
                                 Coon." A black man would stick his head through a hole in a painted canvas; the background
                                 was a plantation scene. White patrons would throw balls -- and in especially brutal
                                 instances, rocks -- at the black man's head to win prizes. A person living in the
                                 21st century who sees that banner or a reproduction gets a glimpse of what it was
                                 like to be a black man in the early years of Jim Crow.<br /><br /> That carnival banner reinforced the idea that blacks were not as human as whites.
                                 It alleviated white guilt about black pain; it suggested that blacks did not experience
                                 pain the way normal people -- whites -- experienced pain. It helped legitimize "happy
                                 violence" directed against blacks. It functioned as an ego boost for the white hurlers.
                                 How many poorly paid, socially marginalized whites expressed their frustration at
                                 the expense of "black heads?" The "Hit the Coon" game and its cousin, "African Dodger,"
                                 were eventually replaced with target games that used wooden black heads. You do not
                                 have to be a psychologist to understand the symbolic violence. Not coincidentally,
                                 games that used blacks as targets were popular when the lynching of real blacks was
                                 increasing in frequency. The Jim Crow Museum has many objects that show blacks being
                                 thrown at, hit, or beaten. We do not have the carnival banner -- but I could teach
                                 a lot with one.<br /><br />

                                 reached its apex when I read <em>The Turner Diaries</em> (1978), written by William L. Pierce, penname Andrew MacDonald.<sup><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span>2</span></span></sup> The book chronicles the "heroism" of white supremacists who overthrow the federal
                                 government, win a bloody race war, and establish a social order where whites rule.
                                 Blacks, other minorities, and the whites who support them are brutally, graphically
                                 killed. This book, arguably the most racist book produced in the second half of the
                                 20th century, has influenced numerous racist organizations, including The Order and
                                 The Aryan Republican Army. Timothy McVeigh, convicted of the 1995 bombing of the Federal
                                 Building in Oklahoma City, was a fan of the book -- and his bombing was eerily similar
                                 to bombings described in <em>The Turner Diaries</em>. I made the mistake of reading it -- all 80,000 words -- in one day, while I was
                                 tired. It consumed me.<br /><br /> Pierce, who holds a Ph.D. in physics from the University of Colorado, bonded with
                                 Nazis in the 1960s. That explains why he wrote the book, but why did it anger me so
                                 much? I had, after all, a basement full of racist memorabilia. I was raised in the
                                 segregated South. I remember the race riots on Davis Avenue in Mobile, Alabama. I
                                 was familiar with the many ways that you can call me a nigger and threaten to hurt
                                 me. The ideas in Pierce's book, though venomous, were not new to me. Yet, that book
                                 shook me.<br /><br /> <img class="imgl" style="margin: 1px 5px; float: left; border: 1px solid black;"

                                      height="199" /> Near that time, I took a colleague's students into the Jim Crow Museum. I showed
                                 them the ugliness, the Mammy, the Sambo, the Brute, the caricatured sores foisted
                                 on black Americans. I showed them. Showed it all. And we went deep, deeper than ever
                                 before, deeper than I meant to go. My anger showed. After three hours they left, all
                                 but two -- a young black woman and a middle-aged white man. The woman sat, paralyzed,
                                 transfixed, and stunned before a picture of four naked black children. The children
                                 sat on a riverbank. At the bottom of the picture were these words: "Alligator Bait."
                                 She sat there, watching it, trying to understand the hand that had made it, the mind
                                 that conceived it. She did not say a word, but her eyes, her frown, the hand at her
                                 forehead all said, "Why, sweet Jesus, why?" The white man stopped staring at the items
                                 and stared at me. He was crying. Not a sob, a single tear stream. His tears moved
                                 me. I walked toward him. Before I could talk, he said, "I am sorry, Mr. Pilgrim. Please
                                 forgive me."<br /><br /> He had not created the racist objects in the room, but he had benefited from living
                                 in a society where blacks were oppressed. Racial healing follows sincere contrition.
                                 I never realized how much I needed to hear some white person, any sincere white person,
                                 say, "I am sorry, forgive me." I wanted and needed an apology -- a heartfelt one that
                                 changes two lives. His words took the steam out of my anger. The Jim Crow Museum was
                                 not created to shock, shame, or anger, but to lead to a deeper understanding of the
                                 historical racial divide. Some visitors to the museum say that I seemed so detached;
                                 I am not, I have struggled to harness my anger and channel it into productive work.<br /><br /> Most people who visit the Jim Crow Museum understand our mission, accept our methods,
                                 and continue the journey toward understanding and improving race relations. But we
                                 have critics. That is to be expected. The 21st century has brought a fear and unwillingness
                                 to look at racism in a deep, systematic manner. The hedonistic desire to avoid pain
                                 (or anything uncomfortable) is counter to our method of directly confronting the ugly
                                 legacy of racism. Moreover, there is a growing desire among many Americans to forget
                                 the past and move forward. "If we just stop talking about historical racism, racism
                                 will go away." It is not that easy. We may not talk openly about race, but that is
                                 not the same as forgetting it. America remains a nation residentially segregated by
                                 race. Our churches, temples, and synagogues are, in the main, racially divided. Old
                                 patterns of racial segregation have returned to many public schools. Race matters.
                                 Racial stereotypes, sometimes yelled, sometimes whispered, are common. Overt racism
                                 has morphed into institutional racism, symbolic racism, and everyday racialism. Attitudes
                                 and beliefs about race inform many of our decisions, big and small. "Let's stop talking
                                 about it," is a plea for comfort -- a comfort denied to blacks and other minorities.
                                 The way to move forward is to confront the historical and the contemporary expressions
                                 of racism, and to do so in a setting where attitudes, values, and behaviors are critiqued.<br /><br /> Several visitors to the museum have asked, "Why don't you have any positive items
                                 in here?" My answer is simple: we are, in effect, a black holocaust museum. I mean
                                 no disrespect to the millions of Jews and others who died at the hands of the maniacal
                                 Adolf Hitler and his followers. I hesitate to use the word "holocaust" to describe
                                 the experiences of Africans and their American descendants because I do not want to
                                 trivialize the suffering of Jews -- nor do I want to compare victimizations. But what
                                 word should I use? Thousands of Africans died during the Trans-Atlantic slave voyage.
                                 Many more lived under the brutal system of slavery, and even after slavery was officially
                                 ended thousands of blacks were lynched -- many ritualistically, by white mobs. We
                                 have today many small "white towns" that were created because the blacks were "driven
                                 out," victims of wanton racial violence.<br /><br /> <img class="imgl" style="margin: 1px 5px; float: right; border: 1px solid black;"

                                 will be told. Artifacts and signage will introduce visitors to the wonderful accomplishments
                                 of black scholars, scientists, artists, and inventors who thrived <em>despite</em> living under Jim Crow. Also, a "Civil Rights Movement" section will be added. There,
                                 visitors will find images of protestors, with signs saying, "I, Too, Am A Man." Visitors
                                 will learn about civil rights workers, many of whom are not found in history books.
                                 This section can be conceptualized as a "Death of Jim Crow" period, though vestiges
                                 of Jim Crow era thinking remain. Finally, there will be a room of reflection. I envision
                                 a mural of civil rights martyrs, from all races, surrounding visitors as they ask
                                 the important question, "What can I do today to address racism?" These will be positive
                                 sections. We also plan to enlarge photographs of blacks being "regular" people: eating,
                                 walking, studying or simply living. These poster-sized images will be placed near
                                 the caricatured objects so that visitors remember that the thousands of objects that
                                 denigrate blacks are distortions, mean-spirited exaggerations -- they are not realistic
                                 depictions. There will be several kiosks with stories from people who lived under
                                 Jim Crow.<br /><br /> Jim Crow was wounded in the 1950s and 1960s. The Supreme Court decision, <em>Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka</em> (1954) ruled segregated schools unconstitutional. This hastened the end of legal
                                 segregation, but it did not end it, as evidenced by the need for the Civil Rights
                                 Movement. Whites, especially northerners, were confronted with images of black protestors
                                 being beaten by police officers, attacked by police dogs, and arrested for trying
                                 to vote, eat at segregated lunch counters, and attend "white" schools. The 1964 Civil
                                 Rights Act, passed after (and maybe because of) President John F. Kennedy's death,
                                 was certainly a blow to Jim Crow.<br /><br /> <img class="imgl" style="margin: 1px 5px; float: right; border: 1px solid black;"
                                      src="http://www.ferris.edu/HTMLS/news/jimcrow/collect/coonsong.jpg"

                                      height="200" /> One by one segregation laws were removed in the 1960s and 1970s. The elimination
                                 of legal barriers to voting led to the election of black politicians in many cities,
                                 including former bastions of segregation such as Birmingham and Atlanta. From this
                                 period forward, white colleges and universities in the South admitted black students,
                                 and hired black professors, albeit often a token number. Affirmative action programs
                                 forced employers in both the public and private sectors to hire blacks and other minorities.
                                 Some blacks appeared on television shows in non-stereotypical ways. Significant racial
                                 problems remained but it seemed that Jim Crow era attitudes and behaviors were destined
                                 to die. Many whites destroyed their household items that defamed black people, for
                                 example, ashtrays with smiling Sambos, "Jolly Nigger" banks, sheet music with titles
                                 like "Coon, Coon, Coon," and children' s books like <em>Little Black Sambo</em>.<br /><br /> Jim Crow attitudes did not die; and in many instances, have resurfaced. The end of
                                 the 20th century found many whites resentful of the "gains" by blacks. Affirmative
                                 Action policies were attacked as reverse discrimination against whites. The slavery-era
                                 Coon caricature of blacks as lazy, ne'er-do-wells re-emerged as a depiction of modern
                                 welfare recipients. White Americans support welfare for the "deserving poor," but
                                 strongly oppose it for persons perceived as lazy and unwilling to work. Black welfare
                                 recipients are seen as indolent parasites. The centuries-old fear of blacks, especially
                                 young black males, as brutes found new life in contemporary portrayals of blacks as
                                 thugs, gangsters, and menaces to society.<br /><br /> <img class="imgl" style="margin: 1px 5px; float: left; border: 1px solid black;"

                                      height="200" /> Black entertainers who capitalize financially on white America's acceptance of anti-black
                                 stereotypes perpetuate many of these images. In popular and material culture, the
                                 Mammy portrayal of black women was replaced by the Jezebel image: black women as hypersexual
                                 deviants. The racial sensitivity that had been promoted in the 1970s and 1980s was
                                 by the end of the century derided as "political correctness."<br /><br /> The new racial climate is marked by ambivalence and contradiction. Most polls about
                                 race show a decline in prejudice among whites. There remains a heightened sense that
                                 racism is wrong and that tolerating "racial others" is good; however, there is a growing
                                 acceptance of ideas critical of and belittling toward blacks and other minorities.
                                 Many whites are tired of talking about race, believing that America has made enough
                                 "concessions" to its black citizens. Some are rebelling against government intrusion,
                                 arguing that the government, especially the federal government, does not have the
                                 right to force integration. Still others wage personal battles against political correctness.
                                 And then there is that segment of the white population that still believes that blacks
                                 are less intelligent, less ambitious, less moral, and more given to social pathological
                                 behaviors: drug abuse, sexual deviance, and crimes against property and persons. Martin
                                 Luther King, Jr., vilified during his life, is hailed as a hero; blacks as a whole
                                 are viewed with suspicion, sometimes alarm.<br /><br /> <img class="imgl" style="margin: 1px 5px; float: right; border: 1px solid black;"

                                      height="170" /> In the early 1990s I attended an academic conference in New Orleans. I searched local
                                 stores for racist objects. There were not many. Ten years later I returned to New
                                 Orleans. I found anti-black objects in many stores. This is disappointing but not
                                 surprising. Brutally racist items are readily available through Internet auction houses,
                                 most notably eBay. Indeed, practically every item housed in the Jim Crow Museum is
                                 being sold on some Internet site. Old racist items are being reproduced and new items
                                 are being created. Each year, Halloween USA produces monster masks by exaggerating
                                 the features of Africans and African Americans.<br /><br /> <img class="imgl" style="margin: 1px 5px; float: left; border: 1px solid black;"

                                 Monopoly, the popular family game, Ghettopoly debases and belittles racial minorities,
                                 especially blacks. Ghettopoly has seven game pieces: Pimp, Hoe, 40 oz, Machine Gun,
                                 Marijuana Leaf, Basketball, and Crack. One of the game's cards reads, "You got yo
                                 whole neighborhood addicted to crack. Collect $50 from each playa." Monopoly has houses
                                 and hotels; Ghettopoly has crack houses and projects. The distributors advertise Ghettopoly
                                 this way: "Buying stolen properties, pimpin hoes, building crack houses and projects,
                                 paying protection fees and getting car jacked are some of the elements of the game.
                                 Not dope enough? If you don't have the money that you owe to the loan shark you might
                                 just land yourself in da Emergency Room." The game's cards depict blacks in physically
                                 caricatured ways. Hasbro, the owner of the copyright for Monopoly, has sued David
                                 Chang to make him stop distributing Ghettopoly.<br /><br /> <img class="imgl" style="margin: 1px 5px; float: right; border: 1px solid black;"

                                 not alone. AdultDolls.net is the distributor of Trash Talker Dolls, a set of dolls
                                 with stereotypical depictions of minorities. Their best seller is Pimp Daddy, a chain-wearing,
                                 gaudily dressed, black pimp who says, among other things, "You better make some money,
                                 bitch." Charles Knipp, a white man, has gained national notoriety for his minstrel-drag
                                 "Ignunce Tour." Knipp, dressed in ragged women's clothes and blackface makeup, adopts
                                 the stage persona Shirley Q. Liquor -- a Coon-like black woman with 19 children. This
                                 self-proclaimed "Queen of Dixie" has many skits -- each portraying all blacks as buffoons,
                                 whores, idlers, and crooks. Knipp's performances are popular in the Deep South; however,
                                 he has been protested in many northern cities (Boykin, 2002). Shirley Q. Liquor collectibles
                                 -- including cassette tapes, drinking glasses, and posters are popular. When satire
                                 does not work, it promotes the thing satirized. Ghettopoly, Trash Talker Dolls, and
                                 Shirley Q. Liquor skits and products portray blacks as immoral, wretched, ill-bred,
                                 cultural parasites. These modern depictions of blacks are reminiscent of the negative
                                 caricatures found more than a century ago. The satire does not work but the distributors
                                 get paid.<br /><br /> Understanding is the principal thing. The Jim Crow Museum's holdings force visitors
                                 to take a stand for or against the equality of all people. It works. I have witnessed
                                 deep and honest discussions about race and racism. No topics are forbidden. What role
                                 have blacks played in perpetuating anti-black caricatures and stereotypes? When, if
                                 ever, is folk art racially offensive? Is segregation along racial lines always indicative
                                 of racism? We analyze the origins and consequences of racist imagery, but we do not
                                 stop there.<br /><br /> I am humbled that the Jim Crow Museum has become a national resource -- and the museum's
                                 Web site, an international resource. The Web site was created by Ted Halm, the Ferris
                                 State University webmaster. Two dozen Ferris State University faculty have been trained
                                 to function as docents -- leading tours and facilitating discussions about the objects.
                                 Traveling exhibits are being conceptualized and built to carry the museum's lessons
                                 to other universities and colleges. Clayton Rye, a Ferris State University professor
                                 and filmmaker, and I created a documentary about the museum. John Thorp served the
                                 museum well as its director until his retirement, as does current director Joseph
                                 "Andy" Karafa. The museum is a team effort. A vision without help is a cathartic dream.<br /><br /> I see my role as decreasing. I have other goals, other garbage to collect. I have
                                 collected several hundred objects that defame and belittle women -- items that both
                                 reflected and shaped negative attitudes toward women. One day I will build a room,
                                 modeled after the Jim Crow Museum, that uses sexist objects to teach Americans to
                                 better understand sexism. That room will be called "The Sarah Baartman Room," named
                                 after a 19th century African woman brutally mistreated by her European captors. Her
                                 victimization was a "perfect" illustration of the links between racism, sexism and
                                 imperialism. There is an African proverb that says that we do not die until we are
                                 forgotten. It is my intention that Sarah Baartman never dies.<br /><br /> Martin Luther King, Jr. said, "Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."
                                 In 2004, Carrie Weis, the Director of the FSU Art Gallery, and I designed and built
                                 a traveling exhibit called, "Hateful Things." This exhibit has traveled to many universities
                                 and museums teaching about the horrors of Jim Crow segregation. In 2005 we began building,
                                 "Them," a traveling exhibit that focuses on material objects that defame non-blacks,
                                 including women, Asians, Jews, Mexicans, and poor whites. Again, our goal is to use
                                 items of intolerance to teach tolerance.<br /><br /> I will end with a story. One of my daughters plays on an elite soccer team, meaning
                                 her practices are never done on time. One day I sat in the van with my other daughter
                                 waiting for practice to end. Nearby several white boys were clowning in front of two
                                 girls. They were all teenagers. One of the boys wore a blackfaced mask and he mocked
                                 the mannerisms of "street blacks." He turned toward us and I immediately looked at
                                 my daughter. She had lowered her head and covered her face. If you have a child then
                                 you know what I felt. If your skin is dark then you know why I do what I do.<br /><br /> © <span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode';"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode';"><span>Dr. David Pilgrim, Professor of Sociology<br /> Ferris State University<br /> Feb., 2005<br /> Edited 2012<br /></span></span></span><hr noshade="noshade" size="1" /><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode';"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode';"><span><sup><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span>1</span></span></sup> Kennedy (1990, p. 234).

    "## Troubleshooting wget: what if there's no directory hierarchy?\n",
    "Although it's not common practice, some sites have no directory hierarchy, and this makes it difficult to scrape them automatically. For instance, Chinook Montessori Charter School's home URL is 'http://www.k12northstar.org/chinook', and if you go to this site you'll find links to other website pages with URLs that are NOT nested within this home URL, e.g. 'http://www.k12northstar.org/Page/2684' and 'http://www.k12northstar.org/Page/2685'. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our problem with directory-less URL structures is that the coding strategy used above really depends on wget's \"recursive\" option, which scrapes the site you give it as well as all sites included within that. For instance, it would scrape not only www.school.com/ but also www.school.com/cafeteria and www.school.com/about_us. This won't work for sites with no directory hierarchy. It may be impossible to separate out the site pages for only the school of interest if the site directory includes multiple schools at a \"flat\" level with no hierarchy... But we won't know until we try!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at coding an automated solution to deal with this problem. Thus far, I've only thought up a painstaking solution that involves feeding wget each site manually. Below is an example of that approach."
